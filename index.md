# Welcome In!

This is my home page for my CPSC120A portfolio my name Ian Gerodias. I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.

### CPSC 120

* [Lab 3] (https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2025/cpsc-120-lab-03-ian-g-and-kevin-f/tree/main) 
    Lab 3 was a very educational experience. I especially enjoyed the README section that discussed BMI, as it introduced real-world calculations and helped connect programming concepts to practical use cases. The assignment reinforced core ideas such as writing functions, making function calls, and understanding basic program structure. Overall, the lab was approachable, clear, and a solid foundation for developing more advanced skills.

* [Lab 6] (https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2025/cpsc-120-lab-06-ian-ruben/tree/main)
    Lab 6 Part 2 was one of my favorites because I was genuinely interested in recreating a simple version of Blackjack programmatically. I implemented functions that correctly computed the value of a hand, even with multiple Aces. Something that can be tricky to handle. Working through these challenges showed me areas where the logic could be optimized, and it made me realize how a small assignment like this could evolve into a much larger, more polished project.

* [Lab 7] (https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2025/cpsc-120-lab-07-ian-zaydee/tree/main)
    Lab 7 was another engaging assignment. Writing and organizing multiple functions helped reinforce the importance of modularity and code reuse. It demonstrated how breaking a problem into smaller, focused components makes programs easier to understand, maintain, and expand.
